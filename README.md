<p>On October 12, the children's national day is celebrated, a very commemorative date, mainly for the children, because besides being their day, they receive a lot of affection from their relatives and win many toys.</p>
<p>However, despite the commemorative date, many children do not share the joy of that day, due to the fact that they have no close relatives, or they were abandoned by the family and end up living in orphanages.</p>
