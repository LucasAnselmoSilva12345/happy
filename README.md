<p>On October 12, the children's national day is celebrated, a very commemorative date, mainly for the children, because besides being their day, they receive a lot of affection from their relatives and win many toys.</p>
<p>However, despite the commemorative date, many children do not share the joy of that day, due to the fact that they have no close relatives, or they were abandoned by the family and end up living in orphanages.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, **Rocketseat**, innovated once again, and this week that we started the third edition of Next Level Week - we developed an application called 'Happy' - which will be a platform for you to search for an orphanage near your location, and go to this orphanage and visit the children at this orphanage, to make their day happier - the main idea of ​​the project.</p>
